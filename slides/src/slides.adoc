== We've chosen JavaEE to build our start-up!

=== No one ever

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Ok, I know there can be some
* Most of the teams I've met didn't choose the technology
* It was there long before them
** And will probably outlive them as well
* There is a decent amount of patterns, templates within the organisation, which hardly ever get re-evalated
--

== This is the way we do things

[details]#because we've always did it like that#

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* That's how legacy get created, where existing patterns are not questions
* That's where people start to hate technology
** They are slapped in the face with "standards"

=== Not so really injection standard

[quote, Apache DeltaSpike documentation]
In case of some versions of Weld (or OpenWebBeans), you have to configure it as a global alternative instead of an `alternative` in `beans.xml`.

[NOTE.speaker]

So we have a standard but still we are not there yet

== After all it's a standard

* This is a popular rant
** But no one really care
* We just usually glue ourselves to a single application server
** And treat it as a single vendor
* And that way our JavaEE is becoming like Spring - not being Spring
* So we don't have much advantage from "following the standard"
* But we loose a lot in terms of the Spring *fanciness* and *flexibility*

{zwsp}

*Just accept it and move forward*
--

== 3 of 5 tips

&num;3 *Limit the boiler plate*

== Meet Apache DeltaSpike

* A set of CDI extensions
* Working on a number of CDI implementations and application servers
** From *Tomcat* / *TomEE*, through *JBoss* / *Wildfly* to *Weblogic*
* Adds some JavaEE flavour to context containers
** Transactions
** Servlet injection
* Adds some of the JavaEE missing parts
** Context aware Bean Validation
** Easier scheduling (with Quartz)

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* `ConstaintValidation` injection
* If you've ever tried working with `Quartz` - these guys really made it easy
--

== DeltaSpike Data

* Like Spring Data but without Spring
* Reduces JPA boilerplate to bare minimum
** Provides implementation of repository pattern for simple queries
** 'Clutter methods' like _save_, _findAll_, _findBy_
* Provides conventions for repository methods `findByNameLikeAndAgeBetweenAndGender`
* Works with _JPQL_ queries and `@NamedQueries`
* Allows pagination, bulk operations and optional results

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* This is something I focused on in most of my projects
* There is too much boilerplate in typical 'business applications'
** CRUD operations in your financial applications
--

[%notitle]
== DeltaSpike Data vs Spring Data

[source, java]
----
import org.apache.deltaspike.data.api.EntityRepository;

@Repository
public interface PersonRepository extends EntityRepository<Person, Long> {
    List<Person> findByAgeBetweenAndGender(int minAge, int maxAge, Gender gender);

    @Query("select p from Person p where p.ssn = ?1")
    Person findBySSN(String ssn);
    @Query(named=Person.BY_FULL_NAME)
    Person findByFullName(String firstName, String lastName);
}
----

[source, java]
----
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;

public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
  List<User> findByLastname(String lastname);

  @Query("select u from User u where u.emailAddress = ?1")
  User findByEmailAddress(String emailAddress);
}
----

== Problems?

*Never (totally) trust the generated code*

* Start with just implementing `EntityRepository` +
  if you need a repository layer at all
* Declare simple queries with query derivation mechanism (parsing) +
  or manual queries
* For more complex queries, add your own query methods to repository

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* For Spring Data named queries comes by convention - through method name
--

== CDI Producer methods

*Producer method* generates an object that can then be injected

* Introduced as a part of JavaEE 6 (JSR-299)
* Prescribes:
** *Contexts* - bindable lifecycle of components
** *Dependency injection* - typesafe injection of components

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Essential part of this element is CDI
* It was an enabler of what we will be talking later on
--

=== CDI Producer methods

When concrete type of the object to be injected may vary at runtime

            return new TestCoder();

    public void dispose(@Disposes EntityManager entityManager) {
        if (entityManager.isOpen()) {
            entityManager.close();
        }
    }

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Designers are pixel perfect - backend engineers are not
* For backend guys - this is totally unnatural, out of the comfort zone
* But when we do web with JSP / JSF - we are forced to do so
--

== Problems with JSP / JSF

* Relatively steep learning curve (compare to LAMP stack)
* Always outside of the modern web stack _hype circle_
* JSP / Servlet approach is too simple (even simplistic)
* JSF is (was) overcomplicated - and a bit against the nature of the web
* No fined grained control over HTML / CSS / JS in component based JSF
* Nothing in between (so far) - lightweight MVC framework

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Huuge learning curve. JSF is complex, that's just true.
* Loads of boiler plate code for JSP / Servlet approach
* JSF Its component nature
** hide the true nature of the Web, work against the web (not supporting GET in JSF within almost 5 years)
** hiding Request/Response from the developer is an enormous mistake
* It's great JSF 2.2 caught up with most of the problems it used to have - *but the web is somewhere else at the moment*
** I know JSF 2.x is to 1.x like EJB 3.x to 2.x - but still

(...) more as the default MVC framework in Java EE and less as an out of the box standalone MVC framework for Tomcat. Examples are ditching its own managed bean model, its own DI system, and its own expression language.
